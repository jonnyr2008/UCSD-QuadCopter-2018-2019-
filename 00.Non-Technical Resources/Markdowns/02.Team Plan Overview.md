# Phase 1 [September 29, 2018 - TBA]

### Divisions:

* Dev Group = Prototype Development Group;
* CV Group = Computer Vision Research Group;

### Objectives:



##### Dev Group:

* Complete hardware sector of the existing prototype
* Develop software interfaces for hardware functionalities
  * stm32 peripheral  driver
  * quad driver
  * necessary middleware & OS
* Develop control software
  * Sensory fusion and conversion
  * data structure
  * control algorithm
  * Anti-drifting and optimization with minimal CV
  * abstract control interface 
* Testing and tuning control algorithm, and lots of **debugging**
* Demo
  * **Altitude** & height control      note: Altitude in rigid body dynamics term
  * Confine drifting
  * Stationary hovering under the aid of CV or related CV modules. Eg. Optical Flow
  * rudimentary obstacle avoidance
* Hardware Testing/Experiments in preparation for the next prototype
* Blueprint for 2nd prototype [revise/revisit/improve/adding from 1st prototype]
  * general improvements & optimization
  * adding communication system
  * adding comprehensive obstacle avoidance system
  * adding SLAM system
  * adding tracking system
* Design hardware for the second prototype
* Design experiment apparatus if necessary

note: order doesn't matter

note: hardware generally is ahead of software

note: try to be conservative for development, pay attention to robustness and flexibilities in design

##### CV Group:

* Continue researching and experimenting
* Finding study materials
* The objective is enriching knowledge, failure is acceptable
* Engage in various methods, Eg:
  * classical machine learning
  * modern machine learning
  * cv technics
  * feature extraction based on vision fused with other sensory input
  * Pattern recognition rather than image recognition
* Familiarize development environment & development board
  * Nvidia TX2 Jetson & Raspberry Pi 3
  * OpenCV & TensorFlow
* Building **Mathematical** background
* Interpreting **theory** and understand how certain models work, especially for AI & ML stuff
* **Testing** theory

note: writing things down for future paper
