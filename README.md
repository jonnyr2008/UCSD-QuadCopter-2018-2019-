# First Prototype 

Objectives: Build a prototype drone that can automatically take off, hover without drifting, and safely land. The primary focus on this prototype is to build a controllable flying platform for future development, thus, most attention shines on flight control with rudimentary CV system as an aid for anti-drifting.
