# First Prototype 

Objectives: Building a prototyping drone with abilities including but not limited to automatically taking off, hovering indoor without drifting, and safely landing. This prototype development primarily focuses on the **control** aspects and serves as a introductory course for us to gain firsthand experience.

###  Development Repositories and Drives

* Embedded System: 
  * [STM32-HAL-Academy](https://github.com/TsunamiTTT/STM32-HAL-Academy), contains a customized stm32 Library based on official HAL(hardware abstraction) library that provides simplified APIs serving as drivers for common stm32 functionalities.
  * [UCSD_IARC_FirmwareDev](https://github.com/Ayilay/UCSD_IARC_FirmwareDev), a customized driver library containing APIs for specific hardware used on our first prototype, such as ESCs, IMU(MEMS), Communication, etc.

* Simulations: 
  * [IMU Attitude Graphical Simulator]()
